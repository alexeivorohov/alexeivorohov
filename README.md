## Hello there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Alexei, and I'm on the geodesic path to a PhD degree in Theoretical Physics.

My primary research interests include relativity and astrophysics, but I also have a keen interest in machine learning, open-source software, and writing nice code.

Currently, I am working on [bhtrace](https://github.com/alexeivorohov/bhtrace), a general-purpose radiative transfer library designed for modeling observations of black holes in non-classical setups.

## Skills
